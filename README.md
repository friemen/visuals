# visuals

GUI library based on reactor, metam and JavaFX.

Currently this is purely experimental stuff!

See the [sample](javafx/src/visuals/javafx/sample.clj) to get a first idea.


## Ingredients of advanced GUI

 - Reactive core ([reactor](https://github.com/friemen/reactor))
 - Capable UI toolkit and set of widgets (currently only *JavaFX*)
 - Data Validation ([examine](https://github.com/friemen/examine), not yet used)
 - Declarative UI form specification (visuals.forml namespace, based on [metam](https://github.com/friemen/metam))
 - Form builder for supported toolkits (visuals.javafx.builder nampespace)
 - Formatting/parsing of data (not yet implemented)
 - Mapping of domain data to/from signals (part of visuals.core namespace)
